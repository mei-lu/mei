description: Learning about the creators behind Card Captor Sakura

I was just curious about the artists behind one of my current anime obsessions. CLAMP doesn't have any vibes as a word other than something I might find at Home Depot. But the Wikipedia page was so much more delightful than I expected:

> The name "Clamp" refers to a storage clamp, in the sense of "a bunch of potatoes".

I find this so fun because it suggests they are a group of mangakas that didn't start with the intention of being taken seriously and have a "brand safe" name. They just wanted to one up their rival group CLUB/Y and chose something that started with a C. It really reflects their initial spirit for drawing is fun and not commericial. It feels genuine and special as a reader/fan of Card Captor Sakura.
