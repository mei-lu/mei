description: I created a cute room from scratch, learning 3D modeling techniques, and how to create interactions with the objects on the browser.

I just did not feel anything towards making the blender donut, so I thought why not model something I care about to learn along the way instead?

I started with modeling a Smiski pen holder, and printed it out at school. It works (kinda) but it's clear to see how it's not satisfactory. In hindsight, it was silly to try and model organics off the bat, as simple as a Smiski seems. If the likeness was even a little bit off, the whole model is doomed.

Instead, furniture in a room was a much better choice because you can, with a bit of effort, build pretty much any furniture item with primitives.
