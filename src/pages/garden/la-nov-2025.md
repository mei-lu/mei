la was beautiful.

it's magical how we drove through mountains in malibu, then immediately we get to see the ocean at el mastador state park.

the pacific palisades are still rebuilding

this trip i tried a mix of just trying to enjoy and taking photos/videos. sometimes i am so dedicated to documenting that i lose the actual feeling of being in the moment. i almost think of documentation as something to get "out of the way" first so then i can properly immerse myself. i think that documentation by nature is a little performative, because you want to show someone what you have done. at the same time, it almost feels like i did not do my due diligence to work hard to record memories as proof that i have "lived". although most of the photos are for my hobonichi techo and for personal enjoyment, i walk the fine line of being present and performing for my journal. in actuality, there is no need to meticulously document all of my experiences as if i enjoyed them to some extent, they will be stored in my memory. photos should exist as some symbol of those moments that prompt me to reminice.

that is not to say there is no joy in the act of photography - there is a special joy in capturing a rare moment: birds in flight, pink sunsets as a back drop to joshua tree, views of catalina island from under water, etc. but i find that joy to be mostly fleeting after "i got the shot", and long term enjoyment more based on the day i lived rather than captured.
